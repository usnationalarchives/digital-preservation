# NARA Risk and Prioritization Matrix Proposed Updates

NARA uses the Risk and Prioritization Matrix to measure the preservation risk of digital file formats in our holdings and to assess formats we anticipate receiving in the future. By answering questions related to the ability to preserve and sustain a file format, we identify relative risk levels.

In an effort to make the Risk Matrix more standardized, scalable, and better aligned with our current practices, the NARA Digital Preservation Unit has performed a comprehensive review and update of all the questions and categories of questions. We are proposing several different kinds of changes, including removing and condensing similar questions, updating the relative weights of questions, enforcing logic pathways for certain types of questions, and adding new questions to address additional risk factors that have emerged over the past decade since the initial version of the Matrix was drafted.

Please submit feedback to digital-preservation@nara.gov or as a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/usnationalarchives/digital-preservation/issues) by May 20, 2024.
