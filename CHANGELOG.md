## [2.6.0] - 2021-12-23

## [2.5.0] - 2021-09-28

### Added

#### General changes to both the 1) Risk and Prioritization Matrix and 2) File Formats Preservation Action Plans
- Added NARA IDs NF00762-NF00767.

### Changed

#### General changes to both the 1) Risk and Prioritization Matrix and 2) File Formats Preservation Action Plans
- NF00486 and NF00487 - updated format names to include “(X3D).”

#### Risk and Prioritization Matrix
- Updated the number of identified files in the combined NARA holdings based on updated Holdings Profile (Profile is internal only).

#### File Formats Preservation Action Plans
- Cleaned up “Preservation Actions” data to simplify the number of options and clarify the intent of the Actions.
	- Formats with the Preservation Action “Retain; Transform” were simplified to “Transform” because in most cases, the original bitstreams are retained regardless.
	- “Retain for Future Transformation” was changed to “Retain for Future Assessment”
	- Documented a new Preservation Action for formats for which the version is currently unspecified. The new Action is to “Identify Version” because in many cases the Preservation Plan depends on knowing the version.

### Fixed

#### File Formats Preservation Action Plans
- Edited NF00311 which should have only included information for DOCX but erroneously included information for older versions of Word as well. The correct NARA preservation plan is to retain, not transform.

## [2.4.0] - 2021-06-29
