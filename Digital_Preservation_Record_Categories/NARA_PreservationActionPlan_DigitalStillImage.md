#### Digital Still Image
Digital still images are digitally encoded representations of the tonal and brightness information of a subject into a bitmap. Data from digital cameras and scanning devices record light characteristics as numerical values into a grid or raster of picture elements (pixels). There are two types of raster file digital image categories: Born-digital still photographs of natural, real-world scenes or subjects produced by digital cameras, and scanned images of textual documents, illustrations, posters, graphics, cartographic records, photographic prints, slides, and negatives. Image file formats are standardized means of organizing and storing rasterized data that can be used on a computer display or printer.

The term raster data is often contrasted with vector data, in which geometrical points, lines, curves, and shapes are based upon mathematical equations, thus creating an image without specific mapping of data to pixel. Bit-depth, spatial resolution, and color encoding, for example, are all important properties of still images. This document deals solely with raster data; information about vector data can be found in the Digital Design and Vector Graphics Preservation Action Plan.



#### Significant Properties of Digital Still Image
To render a digital photograph one must preserve the structural, technical, and descriptive metadata that allow certain appearance properties to persist. Many of the properties native to raster image file formats are the result of industry efforts to develop common standards and interoperability. Many file formats for digital photography and scanning are the same except that most digital cameras create native camera raw proprietary formats, JPEG, and/or DNG. 

Appearance is a critical property for this category, given that the common purpose or use of this type of record is to depict scenic information or to render the informational and artifactual aspects of a scanned original. Tone fidelity, resolution, bit depth, color encoding as well as compression algorithms all contribute to the preservation of the file. There is widespread adoption of most formats for rendering on display devices. A unique property for scanned multi-page documents is descriptive and administrative metadata that may be held external to the electronic record and could be a risk for long term identification of the context.


#### Appearance
| Name  | Definition  | Function Description  |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
|Size  | Determined by bit-depth, spatial resolution, and compression.  |   |
| Color  | Color mode, color space, and color encoding. | Mathematical representations of color information needed to encode and decode color information such as Hue, Chroma, lightness, white point.  |
| Bit-depth  |The number of bits used to indicate color and tone information of a pixel. | High or low bit depth contributes to the pleasing transformation of color accuracy, gradients, and tonal information. Also greatly affects issues such as signal clipping and transformative image editing. | 
| Orientation  |Portrait versus Landscape. |   |



#### Structure
| Name  | Definition  | Function Description  |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Layout Structure  | Embedded technical metadata captured at the time of creation describing, among other things: File format/encoding; Compression; 	Resolution; Bit depth; and EXIF (Exchangeable Image File Format) data.| |



#### Behavior
| Name  | Definition  | Function Description  |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Display  | Image   | The only significant behavior for a digital photograph is the ability to visually render it. Other functionality, such as photo enhancement or manipulation, may be available in the userâ€™s native software environment but is not inherent to the record. |




#### Context
| Name  | Definition  | Function Description  |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
|Metadata  |May include administrative, descriptive, and/or technical metadata. |Metadata can be embedded or saved as a sidecar file. Examples of metadata fields include coding history, origination date, title, creator, collection, unique identifier, etc.   |
