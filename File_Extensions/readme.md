## File Extensions Publishing Information
NARA is publishing file extensions data from our holdings for potential reuse, such as to identify extensions to be researched further for file format identification. The extensions and counts provided are generated by combining reports from various preservation systems for Federal, Legislative, and Presidential electronic records. This dataset is not an exact, up-to-date representation of every file extension and count in NARAâ€™s electronic records holdings. 

In general, file extensions may be misleading as they can be manually changed. Not all file extensions may be clearly relatable to a known file format. In this dataset, extensions with a count of less than 100 have been truncated to 6 characters. Files with no extension (null values) have been excluded from this dataset.
This dataset will be updated as new versions are available.
