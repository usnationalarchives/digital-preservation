# Preservation Action Plan for Email
### National Archives and Records Administration (NARA)

Plan Date: 202503

Template: 202105

#### Email
Email records are created or received via an electronic mail system (EMS), and may include brief notes, formal or substantive narrative documents, and any attachments, which may include files from other content categories, that were transmitted with the message. Email records are often threads, which are a series of messages and replies grouped together in a single conversation or back and forth that are the main components of an email and replies.

This plan doesn’t currently explicitly include other forms of electronic messaging, such as SMS text or chats.


#### Significant Properties of Email
Appearance properties are not generally significant to email, with the possible exception of text, which has similar appearance characteristics to textual records. Layout might also be considered in certain circumstances, as specified below. Behavior/User interaction with email does not generate a property that can be preserved or replicated after the fact.


#### Appearance
| Name  | Definition  | Function Description  |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Font  | The appearance of the message(s). | Font information inclusive of bolding, italics, etc., would apply.  Color, orientation, etc. would not apply. This applies only to the messages; attachments are handled as separate objects.  |
|Layout |Distinct layout in which more than just the discernable data elements themselves provide meaning. |Overall visual layout or structure of highly recognizable email “formats” such as State Department cables, EOP ARMS email, or Defense Messaging System messages.  |
|Message body mark-up |HTML code/documentation that formats the body of the email |Markup may be necessary to preserve, depending on the content and layout of the message.  |



#### Structure
| Name  | Definition  | Function Description  |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Structure  | Proprietary internal structure of a commercial email format. Includes links and connections to other types within the same system (calendar, meetings, etc.). |During transformations, the specific constructs of the proprietary format should be preserved. Markup may be necessary to preserve, depending on the type and format of the message. |
|Attachments (if present) | An identifier that indicates one or more attachments (including inline attachments) are associated with the email.| |
|Original Order |The organization and sequence of records established by the creator of the records. Possible strong association to email, e.g., maintenance of email in folders that indicate separate mailboxes, time periods sent/received, etc. |Preservation of original order for email would most likely come into play in circumstances where email is transferred in distinct folders or directories that reflect a clear operational structure; for example, where email is segregated and transferred by mailbox or username; or where segregated and transferred by blocks of time, such as by week or month.  In such circumstances, that structure would be named as a significant property and should be preserved. |


#### Behavior
| Name  | Definition  | Function Description  |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| User Interaction |  | User interaction with email does not generate a property that can be preserved or replicated after the fact. |


#### Context
| Name  | Definition  | Function Description  |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Subject  |A short string that may identify the topic of the message. The subject line may be blank, indicate the content of the email to which the Sender is replying, or contain other information.   | The Subject may provide qualitative information that indicates the message purpose. Additionally, it may provide a simple method to sort several emails into a thread when used in conjunction with the received date.  |
| Keywords (if present)  |  Words and phrases that may summarize the content of the message. Keywords may be created by the person or software application that creates, receives the message, or archives the message. |   |
| Header  | <br><br><ul><li>Originator/Local-part <li>Originator/Local-part <li>Originator/Domain-part <li>Originator/Domain-literal <li>Originator/Display name (if present) <li>Originator/Relationship <li>Message-ID <li>msg-id <li>Sent Date <li>Received Date <li>Trace-field  | Components that establish provenance and/or relationship between threads.|
| Header- Optional  | <br><br><ul><li>Resent<li>References<li>In-Reply-To  |  Optional components that establish provenance and/or relationship between additional threads or responses|
