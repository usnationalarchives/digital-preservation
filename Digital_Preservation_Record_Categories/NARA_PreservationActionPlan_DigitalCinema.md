# Preservation Action Plan for Moving Image/Digital Cinema Records
### National Archives and Records Administration (NARA)

Plan Date: 20210525
Template: 202105

#### Moving Image/Digital Cinema Records
Digital moving images consist of bitmap digital images or “frames” displayed in rapid succession at a constant rate, giving the appearance of movement. Digital Cinema generally refers to the technology and file formats used to create, distribute, and project motion pictures. Digital Cinema is distinct from digital video (SD, HD, UHD) and does not necessarily use standards pertaining to television or other video standards in regards to aspect ratios, frame rates, and resolution.

Resolution is determined by pixel count, usually 2K or 4K, although higher resolutions are possible. Digital cinema formats are composed of raw camera (multiple formats) or scanned film formats (DPX, TIFF), production formats (Digital Source Master (DSM), Digital Cinema Distribution Master (DCDM), Academy Color Encoding Specification (ACES)), and a delivery format (Digital Cinema Package (DCP) - JPEG2000 and WAV wrapped in MXF).

#### Significant Properties of Digital Cinema Records
To render an authentic digital cinema file one must preserve the structural and technical metadata that allows for proper transmission of the video stream (size, codec, frame rate, interlacing, chroma subsampling, duration, channels, and bit depth).

General requirements for digital video records: Digitize to standards  appropriate for the accurate preservation of the original video, when converting analog material (e.g., video cassettes, open reel video, etc.). For reformatted video, 8-bit is acceptable but 10-bit is preferred.


#### Appearance
| Name  | Definition  | Function Description  |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Size  |Determined by bit depth, frame rate, compression, sub/sampling rate, and duration. | |

#### Structure
| Name  | Definition  | Function Description  |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Layout Structure  | Embedded technical metadata describing, among other things: GUID, file size, format, duration, codec, frame rate, frame width, frame height, bit depth, and bitrate for video and audio components. | |


#### Behavior
| Name  | Definition  | Function Description  |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
|Display | Image | Video signal is made up of Luminance, Chrominance, and frame rate. |
|Audio |Sounds is an audio waveform that has been created as, or converted into digital form and can be heard during playback of the video. | |


#### Context
| Name  | Definition  | Function Description  |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Descriptive Metadata | This includes but is not limited to: Unique identification number assigned by the creator; Title; Creator; Copyright: Summary. |  Digital Cinema Files could contain, or link to: metadata that describes any attribute that could be seen in a recording or provides information about the recording. |
| Technical Metadata| This includes but is not limited to: Originator: Unique identification number assigned by the creator; origination date; coding history; levels.|Digital Cinema Files could contain or link to: data on the recording/ digitizing process.|
|Administrative Metadata | This includes but is not limited to: catalog URL; classification or access level.| Digital Cinema Files could contain, or link to: metadata that describes how/where to access the record.|


#### Current NARA Transfer Guidance for Digital Cinema Records
[Bulletin 2014-04](https://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/bulletins/2014/2014-04.html "Bulletin 2014-04")

- Preferred:  
 - Digital Picture Exchange (DPX)

- Acceptable: 
	- None Specified



#### Current NARA Format(s) for Public Access and Reference for Digital Cinema
Formats for Public Access are those made available online through the National Archives Catalog. Formats for Reference are defined as those made available to researchers upon direct requests for digital copies.

Formats Available for Public Access: Content created or delivered for public access in the Catalog is delivered primarily in the following file formats: PDF (Textual and Image), JPEG (Textual and Image), MP3 (Audio), and MP4 (Audio/Video) and ASCII (Datasets). Other file formats may be present depending on when they were added to the Catalog.

Format(s) Available for Reference: MPEG 4 (H.264)
