The 87a version is the original version and 89a was the second release that added support for animation delays, storage of application metadata, and a few other upgrades. The two versions can be distinguished by the first six bytes of the file. GIF 87a was created by CompuServe in 1987 and 89a was released in 1989. GIF used patent-protected LZW lossless compression; the patent was owned by Unisys but expired in 2003. GIF has an open specification and is well-documented and in wide use with a variety of software to render. It is recommended to retain GIF files as-is since the files can easily be opened and are prevalent in the field. ""Unspecified"" means that we have not yet identified which version of format has been found; these files should be treated as if they possess the risks and limitations inherent in any file in the format family.

ICO files serve as an icon resource that can be a container for multiple images (i.e., BMP or PNG) and the file format also was extended to the CUR file format for Windows' non-animated cursors—both ICO and CUR files have a directory structure. ICO is proprietary and is still in use by Microsoft as a native file format. Due to the prevalence of the Microsoft Windows operating system and its ability to render most ICO files, along with the particular structure of ICO files and how they might relate to other files in context of their usage, it is recommended to retain them as is, with the caveat that ICO files created 1987-2001 (with emphasis on 1987-1995) may possibly originate from the OS/2 operating system and/or contain files from the OS/2 Bitmap family.

ROM files are frequently used in video game preservation to use in an emulated environment. By the mid-1990s, personal computers had progressed to the point where it was technically feasible to replicate the behavior of some of the earliest gaming consoles entirely through software, and the first unauthorized, non-commercial console emulators began to appear. Once an emulator is written, it then requires a copy of the game software to be obtained.Typically, this requires the user to make a ROM image, a process known as """"dumping"""" the contents of the ROM chip found in game cartridges.

It was developed by Microsoft as part of its Windows operating system (most notably Win95 and WinNT), coming into use as a format circa 1992 and ebbing in popularity circa 2007, although the format can still be found in more limited use today although not to the same extent as the Cursor image file format (CUR). The ANI file format is based on the Resource Interchange File Format (RIFF), which is a container format composed of a number of chunks (i.e., self-contained units of data storing specific types of information). The series of chunks therein contain two or more bitmaps, each of which generally has either Windows cursor data, icon data, or possibly raw bitmaps; additionally, the ANI file format contains information that controls the rate and sequence in which frames are displayed. While the ANI file format can be considered proprietary, the specifications for the RIFF format are documented publicly and available. When determining whether to retain ANI files as is or convert to another format, it is ideal to determine if they can still be rendered in a current Microsoft Windows operating system or via a third-party software such as RealWorld Cursor Editor. Due to the prevalence of the Microsoft Windows operating system, along with the particular structure of ANI files and how they might relate to other files in context of their usage it is recommended to retain them as is unless a.) they can no longer easily be rendered and/or b.) the following caveat applies, that ANI files created circa 1992-2001 (with emphasis on 1992-1995) may possibly contain files from the OS/2 Bitmap family.
